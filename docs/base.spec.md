# Tarot Manager
Web application that allows a user to generate and track their tarot readings.  Readings can be entered manually or generated by the application; when entered manually, the spread and cards can be selected from a list, or an image can be scanned.  A history of all reading can be browsed, which can also be filtered and analyzed for statistical data.  Each user's readings are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Backend Web Server
The backend webserver provides webapi services for user management, login, spread entry, and spread queries.

### Open Web Apis
Webapis which do not require a user.

#### /users/register
#### /users/login
#### /users/forgot_password
#### /status

### User Web Apis
User webapis are ones which only apply to normal users, and which use the user token to pick which user key to use when performing actions in the database.

#### /users/logout
#### /users/deactivate
#### /users/info
#### /users/settings
#### /users/tiles
Update the home tiles configuration for the user.

#### /reading/create
#### /reading/edit
#### /reading/share
#### /reading/delete
#### /reading/analyze_image

#### /reading/list
#### /reading/read
* Url Params
  * key - (string)|'last'
#### /reading/stats
* Url Params
  * type - [basic]

#### /msgs/list
* Url Params
  * type - [count|list]
  * filter - [unread|all]
#### /msgs/users
* Url Params
  * sort - [recent|count]
  * limit - (number)
  * type - [unread|all]
#### /msgs/user/{uid}


### Admin Web Apis
Admin webapis are ones which only apply to admin users, and do not directly interact with readings.

#### /users/list
#### /users/disable
#### /users/info/{uid}
#### /users/settings/{uid}


### User Management
* User login checks that the id provided matches the provide password.  The password is salted with a key file in the webserver private directory, and encrypted, before being compared to the password in the database.  If the compare matches, then a user session is created.
* The Web server uses the usersessions table to manage logged in users.  When a user logs in, an entry is created in the sessions table, and any other session for that user with the same session_location is removed.  The generated session_key is then returned for session lookups.
* The web server keeps a local memory copy of the session table for fast session lookup.
  * The cache should be refreshed at least every 5 minutes.  All sessions which exceed the duration timeouts should automatically be deleted.
  * Session login and logout should update the session db automatically.
* Every user api requires the session token be provided, which is compared against the session cache.  If it is found, and interval since session start is under max_session_duration, and the interval since session last activity is under min_session_activity_duration, then the action is allowed.  If over, the api should return a session timeout message.
* The logout command should remove the session that matches the session key.



## UI
The UI is similar for both NextJs website and Electron Application, only the layout differs.  There are 3 ui interfaces:
* Login
* User Dashboard
* Admin Dashboard

### Login
The root page when first accessing the system, providing login, about, user registration, and user recovery.  Only the web code for the login page should be returned; none of the user dashboard or admin dashboard html or js should be returned.

#### Page - Home
Root page, with a panel in the center to show the selected tile, defaulted to the login tile, and the app title at the top.  An about link is displayed at the bottom, as is application version and status.

#### Tile - Login
Displays a username and password entry box, with links for create account and forgot account below, and a login button.
* On login, /users/login is sent to the server.
  * If the response is success, go to the user or admin dashboard, depending on user type.
  * If the response is failed, display invalid credentials, and stay on the login tile.

#### Tile - Create Account
Displays a user create form, with user id, email, and password entry, and a submit below.  Password is required to be strong before submit.  
* On submit, the /users/register api is sent to the server.
  * If the response is success, go to the login screen.
  * If the response is failed, display error, and stay on the create account tile.
* A back link returns to the login screen.

#### Tile - Forgot Account
Displays a email or user entry box, with a submit button.
* Submit sends the entered email or user to the /users/forgot_password api, and displays a message that an email was sent to the associated user.
* A back link returns to the login screen.

#### Tile - About
Displays information about the application.  A back link returns to the login screen.

### User Dashboard
The User Dashboard provides an interface the user can use to view their readings, create new ones, and analyze the history and statistics of those readings.

#### Bar - Info
A bar always displayed on the bottom of the screen, providing info to the user.
* Number of readings recorded.  Hover to show popup - recent readings.
* Most common card.  Hover to show popup - stats.
* Unread Messages.  Hover to show popup - msgs.

#### Bar - Menu
A bar always displayed on the left side of the screen, allowing access to different pages.
* Hide/show arrow allows expanding or collapsing the menu bar.
* Displays links to the following pages:
  * Home
  * Create Reading
  * Reading History
  * Reading Statistics
  * User Settings
  * Logout - Logs the user out, sending /users/logout, and returns to the Login Ui.

#### Popup - Stats
A popup box which displays basic statistics about the user's readings.  Use /reading/stats?type=basic to retrieve.
* Top 5 cards by frequency in the last 2 months.
* Top 3 impression tags in the last 2 months.

#### Popup - Msgs
A popup box which displays a count of unread messages, and a short summary of the most recent from 3 users.
* Use /msgs/list?type=count&filter=unread to get a count of all unread msgs.
* Use /msgs/users?sort=recent&limit=3&type=summary for recent msg summaries.

#### Popup - Recent Readings
A popup box which displays the most recent 3 readings.
* Use /reading/list?count=3&sort=recent to get the list.
* Display each reading sorted by time.
* Each reading should display when, spread type, cards (limit 5), and tags (limit 2).

#### Page - Home
Home dashboard for users, displaying a list of configurable tiles.
* Tiles are rearrangable in a grid.  The grid is in a scrollable container, allowing any number of tiles to be loaded.
* Tiles are arranged toward the top of the grid, with the last 'empty' tile represented by a '+' image, allowing the user to add a tile.
* Each tile has a 'change' icon, and a 'remove' icon, at the top right.
  * Change - Provides a dropdown to select from the list of home tiles
  * Remove - Removes the tile, and resorts the other tiles.
* The top of each tile has the title of the tile, and can be dragged.  If it is dragged into the grid cell of another tile, it is moved to that position, and all the cells before and after are moved up or down to make space.
* Each tile is the same size, with a ratio of 4:3 width:height.
